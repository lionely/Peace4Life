# Peace4Life
This is the repository for a project aimed at
decreasing the number of dogs euthanized in South Korea.

## Dependencies
* WordPress
* MySQL Connector
* BeautifulSoup

# How To Use
To scrape new dogs and add them into our database use:
```python
python main.py
```

# TODOs
* Refactor scraper.py and overall think  about all the imports being done.
* Scraper needs to scrape every time period or so.
* Write more tests for scaper.
* Deploy the website
  - Think more about the adoption ("checkout") process
  - site theme? navigation?
  - admin process?
  - if Admin changes description & then other site updated, what then?
  - how to handle dog adopted in Korea?
  - how to handle dog reappears?
